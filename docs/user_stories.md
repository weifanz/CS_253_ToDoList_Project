<h2>Putting it Together</h2>
<p>As students with packed schedules filled with not only course work but clubs, sports, school events, and other daily requirements, it can be difficult to keep track of it all. The goal of this project is to create a to-do list that allows students to track what tasks, reminders, and events they have upcoming. The to-do list organizes and creates a structure that allows students to efficiently plan out their upcoming days.</p>

<h2>Additional Benefits Beyond Students</h2>

<p>As people who face many new and various responsibilities, tasks and goals, it seems fitting for people to hold and place them all in one place. People want a method that frees them from managing their time, work, and other responsibilities, so they can put more of their time and energy into their objectives.</p>
