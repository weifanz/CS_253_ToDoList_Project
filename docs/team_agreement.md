<h1>Team Contract</h1>
<h2><u>Teamwork:</u></h2>

<ol>
    <h3><li>Team Leaders</h3>Leaders can alternate weekly to track and coordinate the work during their tenure as the leader. This order can repeat once each member has been leader for a cycle. The leader will create the <strong>zoom meeting</strong> if everyone agrees to meet online for a certain week. 
    <ol>
    <li>Week 1: Samuel</li>
    <li>Week 2: Weifan</li>
    <li>Week 3: Aiden</li>

    <li>Week 5-7: (To be announced)</li>
    </ol></li>

<h3><li>Group Decisions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Group decisions will be done by consensus. This ensures that all members have a voice in the decision making process.</li>
    <li>If needed, we can go to a majority vote.</li>
        <ul>If there is an even tie on a majority decision, a couple steps can be taken:
        <ol>
            <li>For each member of the team to voice their opinion and provide reasoning as to why they are making this decision</li>
            <li>Getting a mediator like Prof. George to help guide our thinking. For example, he might explain that one method of thinking might be very complicated and would be difficult to complete in a certain time frame that we have to complete the project.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<u><h2>Expectations:</h2></u>
<ol>
    <li>We can be flexible with punctuality and attendance but it should not be a common practice to be late to each meeting. Everyone should make an effort to participate in the meeting. It is important we create an environment that allows everyone to feel comfortable sharing their ideas.
    <ol>
        <h4><li>For participation:</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>Offering ideas / Other plans of action</li>
            <li>Voicing opinions on direction and clarification</li>
            <li>Voting when a group decision needs to be made</li></ol></li>
        <h4><li>For code:</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>Make clear documentations</li>
            <li>Remind the team about any potential changes about the repository</li>
            </ol>
        </li></ol>
    <li>When working on code in the meeting, two groups of two will be made with one driver and the other assisting with code.
        <ol>
        <li>As we continue to break down the code into simpler bits of work, each member can choose which bit of code they want to do or can be assigned.</li>
        <li>The goal is to creat bits of code that can be completed by each member by the time we meet each week.</li>
        <ul><li>
        If code for a certain part proves to be more difficult, a member can reach out to the team through the group text and divulge what the bug, or issue is. The group can assist the member in working through the issue or bringing it back to the group meeting with ideas on how to fix the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Communication:</li>
        <ol>
        <li>
        If any problems or issues arise like unexpected situations/emergencies, it is acceptable to miss a meeting or work.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Do your best to communicate this with the team so we can figure out how best to support each other and the work</li></ul>
        <li>Feel free to bring up issues, bugs, or any other situations about the project in the group chat so everyone can be alerted and a solution can be worked out with the team.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
